# Portfolio

This is my portfolio site, which contains a description of my web development skills and projects. You can visit the site [here](https://ryangroch.github.io/).

The site was created with Astro and TailwindCSS. The website [formsubmit.co](https://formsubmit.co/) handles the contact form.

## Current Projects

Currently, I am showcasing the following projects:

- An app called [Retrieve Jobs](https://retrieve-jobs.vercel.app/), which fetches job output from mainframes. This project actively serves 100+ users.
- An ecommerce store that I made for a client, called [Lightspeed Triggers](https://lightspeed-triggers.vercel.app/).
- An [Othello AI](https://ryangroch.github.io/othello-ai-v2/), which uses the minimax algorithm.
- A [Sudoku puzzle generator and solver](https://ryangroch.github.io/sudoku-v2/), which uses recursive backtracking to generate random Sudoku puzzles and solve them. The user can also play through the puzzles, if they choose.

## Running Locally

Make sure that you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) (and thus [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)) installed. You can then use npm to install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/), which this project uses for development and package management:

```sh
npm install -g pnpm
```

After ensuring that you have pnpm installed, you can then install all required dependencies:

```sh
pnpm install
```

Finally, run the development server:

```sh
pnpm run dev
```
